Orientation: Rectangle with additional rectangle model mounted on plastic

Top and bottom chips are connected directly via socket, additional module physically touching but not connected to lower module except via cable

Software licensing indicates the use of: BROADCOM (CYPRESS) WICED SDK, 1.20, FOR CORTEX-M3. AMTEL SAM4S PERPHERAL LIBS.

NOTE: DUE TO POOR TYPEFACE SELECTION AND SIZE the number one (1), lowercase L (l), and uppercase I may all look the same. 6 and G are remarkably alike as well.
