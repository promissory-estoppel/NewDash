# NewDash - 

(Amazon Dash(tm) aka Dash Wand OR83YV)

Seeing what else the Dash can do

I couldn't help but fill out the legal section first. Read it. 

At some point I got an Amazon Dash without consciously ordering one. The page says May. The bar was crazy.

I actually never used the damn thing because one doesn't really reorder til they're out, right? Also the voice thing is weird. I enjoy public speaking but talking to a machine is strange. At least there's a video screen present if you represent someone incarcerated at a motion hearing or on a pretrial docket. This is just you talking to a stick and scanner. Also, I'm not 100% sure I actually ordered it since it was free and didn't come with any instructions outright. In any case, I canceled my Fresh last weekend since it's more convenient (like, within hours instead of days) to use a more local service. Since character and fitness as of this writing will be coming up soon I took special care reading the terms to make sure that it's not a rental (not addressed but since they sent it to me in NY and WA law doesn't really have an equivalent I'm pretty sure I own this thing). Anyway, I'm sure the hardware is similar enough with some added stuff. OR83YV is my particular device's model and its serial number is printed as well. Having screwed around with the wifi thing that controls my AC I figure uninitialized it's probably connectable as a hotspot, and indeed it is, giving me the MAC address and firmware on 192.168.0.1.

Interestingly enough it broadcasts the page from a 44:39:c4 and display a A0:02:DC. They also have an SSL protected version, with a legit cert from DigiCert CA-3, pointing to www.configuremydash.com and valid from May 26, 2014 to June 1, 2015. SHA-256, AES-256, the usual. Site is Amazon registered but doesn't resolve, and has no history of being resolvable, although it does point to 50.63.202.59, Godaddy registered and managed by Markmonitor. https://fccid.io/2ABD7-5363 shows the device's FCC ID and proposals. 802.11.n 20Mhz and so far the pattern is pretty similar to that of the Dash button. 

Ok, here's the secret, you don't really need to go through all the trouble of trial and error because copyright and licensing laws have that taken care of for you. Yes, lawyers to the rescue. https://fresh.amazon.com/dash/notice lists all the stuff they don't havee the rights to distribute without the notice appended (also effectively shows the limits of their rights). Also, since it's radio equipment, the agency in charge is the FCC in the US and a host of agencies - one in every country - that would have delineated requirements. So we can actually gather what's in the thing without opening it.

TODO:

Go through the licensing (hint: BCOM (now Cypress) WICED SDK is involved
nmap the thing
either find a torx key or set up a dns directing the pre-set command to go someewhere else, or why not both?
