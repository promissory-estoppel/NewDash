Getting this out of the way first:

#  Broadcom/Cypress 
WICED SDK including:
#  Express Logic   
ThreadX - RTOS
NetX_Duo - DUAL STACK 
#  Cypherbridge
uSSL - Software stack and dHTTP webserver
#  Newlib/Libgloss libraries to https://sourceware.org/ml/newlib/2011/msg00557.html - Package looks like 1.20 or so
Newlib (C lib for embedded systems) https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=newlib-cygwin.git
Libgloss 
#Atmel
Some sort of ARMv7 or 7-E (ARM Cortex M3 or M4) based microcontroller for the WICED and a separate controller for BLE I'm thinking. 

Overall it is probbably similar to the Dash Button with a bit more for the voice, TLS (although I haven't seen it used yet, will leave wireshark on a bit longer), and raw HTML gets sent. Target port seems to be in the 5040x range.
